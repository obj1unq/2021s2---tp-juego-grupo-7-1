# AutomatizaciÃ³n de commit > cierre issue

Just include #xxx in your commit message to reference an issue without closing it.

With new GitHub issues 2.0 you can use these synonyms to reference an issue and close it (in your commit message):

- fix #xxx
- fixes #xxx
- fixed #xxx
- close #xxx
- closes #xxx
- closed #xxx
- resolve #xxx
- resolves #xxx
- resolved #xxx
You can also substitute #xxx with gh-xxx.

Referencing and closing issues across repos also works:

fixes user/repo#xxx
